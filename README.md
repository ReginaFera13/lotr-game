# LOTR Game

For my Code Platoon Personal Project I wanted to try to make a game using react three fiber. This project was very challenging and I learned that using react three fiber was not an optimal setup. I came across issues to do with useState,as well as limited documentation and many other issues. This was a neat project to attempt, but I think my time would be better spent creating a game with a real game engine such as Unity. Because of this I will not be continuing this project and instead will be turning my attention to other projects.
